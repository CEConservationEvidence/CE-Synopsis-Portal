# Code of Honour (Contributor Covenant v2.1)

## Our Pledge
We, as members, contributors, and leaders, pledge to make participation in our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming, diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.

## Our Standards
Examples of behaviour that contributes to a positive environment include:
- Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward other people  
- Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences  
- Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback  
- Taking responsibility and apologising to those affected by our mistakes, and learning from the experience  
- Focusing on what is best not just for us as individuals, but for the overall community

Examples of unacceptable behaviour include:
- The use of sexualised language or imagery, and sexual attention or advances of any kind  
- Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks  
- Public or private harassment  
- Publishing others’ private information, such as a physical or email address, without their explicit permission  
- Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

## Enforcement Responsibilities
Community leaders are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards; they will take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any behaviour they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

## Scope
This Code applies within all community spaces, and also when an individual is officially representing the community in public spaces (e.g., using an official email address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative).

## Enforcement
Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behaviour may be reported to the community leaders responsible for enforcement at **[alhasacademy@gmail.com]**. All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.

All community leaders are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the reporter of any incident.

## Enforcement Guidelines
Community leaders will follow these guidelines in determining the consequences for any action they deem in violation of this Code:

1. **Correction** — *Impact*: Use of inappropriate language or other behaviour deemed unprofessional or unwelcome. *Consequence*: A private, written warning and clarification of expected behaviour.  
2. **Warning** — *Impact*: A single incident or series of actions. *Consequence*: A warning with consequences for continued behaviour.  
3. **Temporary Ban** — *Impact*: A serious violation of community standards, including sustained inappropriate behaviour. *Consequence*: A temporary ban from any sort of interaction or public communication with the community.  
4. **Permanent Ban** — *Impact*: Demonstrating a pattern of violation of community standards, including sustained inappropriate behaviour, harassment of an individual, or aggression toward or disparagement of classes of individuals. *Consequence*: A permanent ban from any sort of public interaction within the community.
