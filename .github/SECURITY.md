# Security Policy

## Supported Versions
- `main` and the most recent tagged release are actively supported.
- Older snapshots may receive fixes on a best-effort basis only.

## Reporting a Vulnerability
- Email **alhasacademy@gmail.com** or open a private Security Advisory via GitHub.
- Add as much detail as possible: affected component, steps to reproduce, impact, and any suggested remediation.
- Do **not** create a public issue or pull request that describes the vulnerability before we agree on disclosure timing.

## What to Expect
- We aim to acknowledge reports within **10 business days**.
- You will receive status updates at least once every **20 business days** until resolution.
- When a fix is ready, we will coordinate a publication date and credit you (if desired).

## Responsible Testing Guidelines
- Only test against environments and data you control.
- Avoid actions that degrade service quality (e.g., denial-of-service or spam).
- Never access, modify, or delete data that is not yours; report the issue instead.

## Out of Scope
- Vulnerabilities in third-party dependencies should be reported upstream.
- Issues limited to development tooling or documentation typos should use the standard issue tracker.
