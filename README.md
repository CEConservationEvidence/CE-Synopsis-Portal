# "CE Synthesis Portal" (working title, name to be agreed with the CE team)

A unified, open-source workspace to **plan, search, screen, summarise, review, assemble and publish** Conservation Evidence synopses — with one source of truth, clear roles, and minimal copy–paste. This repository will be self-contained, meaning it will house both the documentation and the codebase.

---

## Purpose

Create a single, central tool that replaces scattered Word/Excel files and manual CMS steps. This tool will (eventaully) make it **faster, clearer, and less error-prone** for the CE team to produce synopses, while remaining flexible enough to reuse for other “living evidence” topics.

---

## Who it serves

- **Authors** – import/search, screen, write 200-word summaries, tag studies.
- **[CE] Project Manager** – officially invite advisory board members, oversee progress, review/approve, manage timelines.
- **Data Manager** – manage imports, vocabularies, consistency checks.
- **Advisory Board** – view protocols, comment, approve scope/actions; provide their input directly.
