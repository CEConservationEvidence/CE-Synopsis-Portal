---

## Reporting Issues
- Before opening a new issue, **search the issue tracker** to see if it’s already reported.  
- Use the **issue template** (already provided) to ensure we get all necessary details.  
- Be clear and provide:
  - Steps to reproduce
  - Expected vs actual behavior
  - Environment details (OS, version, etc.)
  - Screenshots/logs if helpful

---

## Suggesting Features
- Open a **feature request issue** using the template.  
- Clearly explain the problem your feature would solve.
