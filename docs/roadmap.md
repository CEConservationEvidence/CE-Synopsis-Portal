# CE Synopsis Portal Roadmap

_The roadmap outlines the key phases and milestones for the development of the CE Synopsis Portal. It only provides a high-level overview and is subject to change as the project evolves._

## Phase 1: Foundation
- Set up project structure and initial documentation/details.
- Gather requirements and feedback from the CE team.
- Develop core data models and database schema as draft.

## Phase 2: Core Features
- Finalize data models and database schema (or at the very least, have a solid draft). **Note that the data model and database schema are likely to change throughout development.**
- Build the import and screening functionality (i.e. RIS file ingestion, duplicate detection, and initial screening UI).
- Create the summary editor with metadata fields.
- Build screening dashboard and PDF viewer.
