# CE Synopsis Portal Roadmap

The project roadmap outlines the key phases and milestones for the development of the CE Synopsis Portal. The timeline is structured into 6 sprints, each focusing on specific deliverables and objectives. Updated regularly.

_Tasks overlap to maximize the 5-month window. Foundations first, then the heaviest pain points, then assembly/publish and cutover._

## Sprint 1: Foundation
- [x] Set up project structure and initial documentation.
- [x] Gather initial high-to-low requirements and feedback from the CE team (requirements gathering will continue throughout development).
- [x] Draft core data models and database schema.
- [x] Setup PostgreSQL database schema.
- [x] Draft synopsis protocol builder.
- [x] Draft advisory board invitation.
- [x] Draft user roles and permissions.

## Sprint 2: Core Features & Functionality (current sprint)
- [x] Finalize data models and database schema (or at the very least, have a solid working version). **Note that the data model and database schema are likely to change throughout development.**
- [x] Build the synopsis protocol builder.
- [x] Build the advisory board invitation UI.
- [ ] Build the import and screening functionality (i.e. RIS file ingestion, duplicate detection, and initial screening UI).
- [ ] Migrate a test sample dataset for testing; run initial queries to validate data integrity.

## Sprint 3: Core Features & Functionality 2
- [ ] Build the summary editor with metadata fields.
- [ ] Build PDF viewer for references (authors can annotate and highlight/edit reference PDFs).
- [ ] Build screening dashboard and PDF viewer.
- [ ] Create dashboards and alerts for user roles.
- [ ] Implement document-to-PDF conversion functionality (for the final synopsis document for website upload).

## Sprint 4: Pilot Testing, Optimization and Scaling
- [ ] Improve performance and scalability of the application (optimisation).
- [ ] Pilot test with all users to gather feedback, mimic real-world usage.
- [ ] Enhance user interface and user experience (based on user feedback and pilot testing).
- [ ] Draft API integration for front-end and back-end communication (uploading synopsis-related data automatically to website).

## Sprint 5: Finalization and Launch
- [ ] Migrate existing data for centralization.
- [ ] Implement API integration for front-end and back-end communication (uploading documents, fetching data, etc.).
- [ ] Launch the CE Synopsis Portal officially (help oversee the transition by CE team).

## Post-Launch Support
- [ ] Teach users how to use the new system.
- [ ] Finalize documentation and user guides.
- [ ] Conduct thorough testing and quality assurance.
- [ ] Monitor system performance.
- [ ] Provide ongoing maintenance and updates.
- [ ] (Potentially) Plan for future enhancements and feature requests.

## Notes

- The timeline for each phase will be flexible but will aim to adhere to the overall project timeline.
- Regular check-ins will be scheduled to assess progress and make adjustments as needed.
